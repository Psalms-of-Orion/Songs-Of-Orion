	description = "You are the managing officer for the local branch of the Starboard Freight Syndicate.<br>\
	A staunch entrepreneur, you are motivated by profit, for the guild and especially for yourself. You are here firstly to make as much money as you can, and secondly to keep the crew supplied. You can order things at cargo using the local branch funds, these will not magically replenish so you will run out of money quickly if you don't charge. Take payments by card or cash, and deposit them into the branch's account to enable more purchases.<br>\
	<br>\
	The Syndicate also operates all the vendors on the ship, every credit paid into them goes to your guild account. Naturally operating is a two way street, you are expected, when necessary, to refill those vendors. Or send a technician to do it<br>\
	<br>\
	You do not recieve a salary, but the local branch funds are yours to use. You may pay yourself as much as you like from that account, take the funds and use them for any purpose.  Bribery is a good one, you can get people to do a lot of things if you flash some cash, and its a good idea to keep a few thousand credits on hand in-cash to bribe your way through potentially difficult situations.<br>\
	<br>\
	Things to bear in mind:<br>\
	-Nobody has a right to free stuff. You are well within your rights to charge for anything you distribute, and you won't make a penny if you don't.<br>\
	-Loyalty is a priceless resource, yet cheap to maintain. Don't screw over the hackers and technicians working under you. <br>\
	-Charity is a weapon. Used correctly, it can do wonders for your public image.  A few gifts spread around makes for good returning customers"

	duties = "Keep the crew supplied with anything they might need, at a healthy profit to you of course<br>\
	Buy up valueable items from scavengers, and make a profit reselling them<br>\
	Deploy your hackers and agents to produce and distribute advanced technologies- or basic tools.<br>\
	Counsel the captain on directing the station towards profitable opportunities."

	Your second loyalty is to your underlings, they'll do quite a bit if it means a chance at profit or advancement within the organization. If you make an enemy of everyone, it may prove a costly mistake"
